# Mondrian Tiles / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWeLQdtT35Y)

Directly inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian. I worked on a method of generating similar images to his compositions and added some rectangle seperation for a cool effect. Plenty to play around with in this one and I will definitely reuse the rectangle subdivision process in other projects.

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module. Reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
